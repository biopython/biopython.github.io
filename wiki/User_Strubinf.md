Hi,

My name is [Thomas
Hamelryck](http://wiki.binf.ku.dk/User:Thomas_Hamelryck).

I am group leader of the [Structural Bioinformatics
group](http://www.binf.ku.dk/research/structural_bioinformatics/) at the
[Bioinformatics Center](http://www.binf.ku.dk) at [Copenhagen
university, Denmark](http://www.ku.dk).

My main biological interests are the prediction and simulation of the
structure and dynamics of proteins and RNA, and protein design. I am the
original author of Biopython's Bio.PDB module.

-Thomas
