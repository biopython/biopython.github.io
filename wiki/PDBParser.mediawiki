This is a draft page for the PDBParser class.

= Benchmark =

A performance benchmark of the parser was carried out to evaluate wether the development of new features degraded the overall parsing speed. 

== Datasets ==

[http://release.cathdb.info/v3.4.0/CathDomainList CATH Domain Collection] - 11330 Structures containing only coordinate information (no Element assigned).

[ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/ Protein Data Bank Collection] - 72836 Structures containing both headers and coordinate information.

== Versions Tested ==

[http://biopython.org/DIST/biopython-1.49.zip Biopython 1.49]  (Nov. 2008)

[https://github.com/biopython/biopython Biopython 1.57+] (May 2011) | Element column auto-assignment.

[https://github.com/JoaoRodrigues/biopython/tree/pdb_enhancements Biopython PDB branch] (May 2011 @ Github) | Warnings module replaced _handle_pdb_exception() && Other minor changes

== Benchmarking Script ==

The following script was used to benchmark the parser. The garbage collection module - <b>gc</b> - was necessary to avoid dead objects still in memory causing the machine to start swapping.
