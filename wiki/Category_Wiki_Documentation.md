-   The [Biopython Tutorial and
    Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
    ([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf))
    contains the main bulk of the Biopython documentation. It provides
    information to get you started with Biopython, in addition to
    specific documentation on a number of modules.

-   You can view the [Biopython's built-in API
    documentation](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api) online (created
    with [Epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/)), or from within
    Python using the help function.
