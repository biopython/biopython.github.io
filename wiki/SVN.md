Until 2008, Biopython and all the other [Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](http://open-bio.org) projects used [CVS](CVS "wikilink") to
manage their source code repositories. Most of the other projects have
now migrated from CVS to Subversion (SVN). Biopython is considering
[moving over to SVN](Subversion_migration "wikilink"), but has now
started [evaluating git instead](GitMigration "wikilink").

Over on the BioPerl wiki, they have [SVN usage
instructions](bp:Using_Subversion "wikilink") which would generally
apply to Biopython after the migration.
