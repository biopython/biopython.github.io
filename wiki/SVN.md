Biopython and other [Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](http://open-bio.org) projects originally used
[CVS](CVS "wikilink") to manage their source code repositories.

Most of the other projects have now migrated from CVS to Subversion
(SVN).

Biopython considered [moving over to
SVN](Subversion_migration "wikilink"), but instead [migrated to
git](GitMigration "wikilink").
