Until 2008, Biopython and all the other [Open Bioinformatics
Foundation](http://open-bio.org) projects used [CVS](CVS "wikilink") to
manage their source code repositories. Most of the other Projects have
now migrated from CVS to Subversion (SVN). Biopython will also be
[moving over shortly](Subversion_migration "wikilink").

Over on the BioPerl wiki, they have [SVN usage
instructions](bp:Using_Subversion "wikilink") which will generally apply
to Biopython after the migration.
