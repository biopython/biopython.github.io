### Introduction

BioPython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation
written in python by an international team of developers.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
applications which address the needs of current and future work in
bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the [Biopython
License](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/LICENSE), which is extremely
liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world. We work
along with the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://open-bio.org),
who generously provide web and [CVS](CVS "wikilink") space for the
project.

This wiki holds some of the online documentation for the project and
will be able to help you get BioPython, install it and start using the
tools that it contains.
