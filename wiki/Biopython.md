### Introduction

Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation
written in [Python](http://www.python.org) by an international team of
developers.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
applications which address the needs of current and future work in
bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the [Biopython
License](https://github.com/biopython/biopython/blob/master/LICENSE.rst), which is extremely
liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world.

We are a member project of the
[Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](http://open-bio.org),
who take care of our domain name and hosting for our mailing list etc.
The OBF used to host our development repository, issue tracker and
website but these are now on [GitHub](https://github.com/biopython).

This page will help you download and install Biopython, and start using
the libraries and tools.
