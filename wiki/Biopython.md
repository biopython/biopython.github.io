### About the Biopython Project

The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of
freely available [Python](http://www.python.org) tools for computational
molecular biology.

It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
applications which address the needs of current and future work in
bioinformatics. The source code is made available under the [Biopython
License](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/LICENSE), which is extremely
liberal and compatible with almost every license in the world. We work
along with the [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](http://open-bio.org),
who generously provide web and [CVS](CVS "wikilink") space for the
project.

### Using Biopython

See [Getting Started](Getting_Started "wikilink") and our
[Documentation](Documentation "wikilink"), in particular the [Biopython
Tutorial and
Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)).

### Download Current Release

The latest release is Biopython 1.50, released on 20 April 2009. Get it
