I've been using Biopython at my [lab](http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/) at the
University of Georgia since January 2009. I take an interest in protein
structure and phylogenetics, mainly.

For Google Summer of Code 2009, I'm writing the
[PhyloXML](PhyloXML "wikilink") module to support the
[phyloXML](http://www.phyloxml.org) format.

I'm on [GitHub](http://github.com/etal), too.
