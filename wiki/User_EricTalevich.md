I've been using Biopython since January 2009, starting in grad school at
my [lab](http://esbg.bmb.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia.
For Google Summer of Code 2009, I wrote the [Phylo](Phylo "wikilink")
module to initially support the [PhyloXML](PhyloXML "wikilink") format,
and later generalized it to support multiple formats (inspired by SeqIO
and AlignIO). The Biopython community's friendliness, wisdom, support and good
cheer motivated me to get involved and continue in open source software
development.
