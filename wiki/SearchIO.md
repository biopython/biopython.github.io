Matching the names in BioPerl, Biopython has a [SeqIO](SeqIO "wikilink")
module for sequence file input/output, and [AlignIO](AlignIO "wikilink")
for multiple sequence alignment input/output. The third member of the
BioPerl trio is SearchIO, and a Biopython equivalent was written during
summer 2012 by [Google Summer of Code](Google_Summer_of_Code "wikilink")
student Wibowo Arindrarto ([blog](http://bow.web.id/blog/tag/gsoc/)).

This covers pairwise sequence search file input/output, for example from
BLAST, HMMER, BLAT, or Bill Pearson's FASTA suite. See the [BioPerl
SearchIO HOWTO](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/HOWTO:SearchIO) for
background.

It is included in Biopython 1.61 onwards as an *experimental* module if
you want to test it.
