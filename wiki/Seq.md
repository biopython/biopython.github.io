In Biopython, sequences are usually held as ` Seq` objects, which add
various biological methods on top of string like behaviour.

This page describes the Biopython `Seq` object, defined in the `Bio.Seq`
module (together with related objects like the `MutableSeq`, plus some
general purpose sequence functions). In addition to this wiki page,
there is a whole chapter in the
[Tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)) on the
`Seq` object - plus its [API
documentation](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Seq.Seq-class.html)
(which you can read online, or from within Python with the help
command).

If you need to store additional information like a sequence identifier
or name, or even more details like a description or annotation, then we
use a [`SeqRecord`](SeqRecord "wikilink") object instead. These are the
sequence records used by the [`SeqIO`](SeqIO "wikilink") module for
reading and writing sequence files.

The Seq Object
==============

The `Seq` object essentially combines a Python string with biological
methods. For example:

``` pycon
>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> my_seq = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
>>> my_seq
Seq('AGTACACTGGT')
```

Biopython doesn't know if this is a nucleotide sequence or a protein rich
in alanines, glycines, cysteines and threonines. If *you* know, keep this
mind when you call methods like (reverse)complement - see below.


General methods
---------------

The `Seq` object has a number of methods which act just like those of a
Python string, for example the find method:

``` pycon
>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> my_dna = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
>>> my_dna
Seq('AGTACACTGGT')
>>> my_dna.find("ACT")
5
>>> my_dna.find("TAG")
-1
```

There is a count method too:

``` pycon
>>> my_dna.count("A")
3
>>> my_dna.count("ACT")
1
```

However, watch out because just like the Python string's count, this is
a *non-overlapping* count!

``` pycon
>>> "AAAA".count("AA")
2
>>> Seq("AAAA", generic_dna).count("AA")
2
```

In some biological situations, you might prefer an overlapping count
using `count_overlap` which would give three for this example.

Nucleotide methods
------------------

If you have a nucleotide sequence you may want to do things like take the
reverse complement, or do a translation. Note some of these methods described
here are only available in Biopython 1.49 onwards.

### Complement and reverse complement

These are very simple - the methods return a new `Seq` object with the
appropriate sequence:

``` pycon
>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> my_dna = Seq("AGTACACTGGT")
>>> my_dna
Seq('AGTACACTGGT')
>>> my_dna.complement()
Seq('TCATGTGACCA')
>>> my_dna.reverse_complement()
Seq('ACCAGTGTACT')
```

### Transcription and back transcription

If you have a DNA sequence, you may want to turn it into RNA. In
bioinformatics we normally assume the DNA is the coding strand (not the
template strand) so this is a simple matter of replacing all the
thymines with uracil:

``` pycon
>>> my_dna
Seq('AGTACACTGGT')
>>> my_dna.transcribe()
Seq('AGUACACUGGU')
```

Naturally, given some RNA, you might want the associated DNA - and again
Biopython does a simple U/T substitution:

``` pycon
>>> my_rna = my_dna.transcribe()
>>> my_rna
Seq('AGUACACUGGU')
>>> my_rna.back_transcribe()
Seq('AGTACACTGGT')
```

If you actually do want the template strand, you'd have to do a reverse
complement on top:

``` pycon
>>> my_rna
Seq('AGUACACUGGU')
>>> my_rna.back_transcribe().reverse_complement()
Seq('ACCAGTGTACT')
```

The chapter in the
[Tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)) goes into
more detail on this strand issue.

### Translation

You can translate RNA:

``` pycon
>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> messenger_rna = Seq("AUGGCCAUUGUAAUGGGCCGCUGAAAGGGUGCCCGAUAG")
>>> messenger_rna.translate()
Seq('MAIVMGR*KGAR*')
```

Or DNA - which is assumed to be the coding strand:

``` pycon
>>> from Bio.Seq import Seq
>>> coding_dna = Seq("ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG")
>>> coding_dna.translate()
Seq('MAIVMGR*KGAR*')
```

In either case there are several useful options - by default as you will
notice the in example above translation continues through any stop
codons, but this is optional:

``` pycon
>>> coding_dna.translate(to_stop=True)
Seq('MAIVMGR')
```

Then there is the translation table, for which you can give an [NCBI
genetic code number or
name](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi):

``` pycon
>>> coding_dna.translate(table=2)
Seq('MAIVMGRWKGAR*')
>>> coding_dna.translate(table="Vertebrate Mitochondrial")
Seq('MAIVMGRWKGAR*')
```

You can of course combine these options:

``` pycon
>>> coding_dna.translate(table=2, to_stop=True)
Seq('MAIVMGRWKGAR')
```

Consult the tutorial for more examples and arguments (e.g. specifying a
different symbol for a stop codon), or see the built in help:

``` pycon
>>> help(coding_dna.translate)
...
```
