Introduction
------------

`Bio.PDB` is a Biopython module that focuses on working with crystal
structures of biological macromolecules. This document gives a fairly
complete overview of `Bio.PDB`.

Bio.PDB's Installation
----------------------

`Bio.PDB` is automatically installed as part of Biopython. Biopython can
be obtained from <http://www.biopython.org>. It runs on many platforms
(Linux/Unix, windows, Mac,...).

Who's using Bio.PDB?
--------------------

`Bio.PDB` was used in the construction of [DISEMBL](http://dis.embl.de/), a web
server that predicts disordered regions in proteins , and COLUMBA, a website
that provides annotated protein structures (*not longer available?*). `Bio.PDB`
has also been used to perform a large scale search for active sites similarities
between protein structures in the PDB (see [*Proteins* **51**: 96–108,
2003](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10338)), and to develop a new
algorithm that identifies linear secondary structure elements (see [*BMC
Bioinformatics* **6**: 202,
2005](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/202)).

Judging from requests for features and information, `Bio.PDB` is also used
by several LPCs (Large Pharmaceutical Companies :-).

Is there a Bio.PDB reference?
-----------------------------

Yes, and I'd appreciate it if you would refer to `Bio.PDB` in publications
if you make use of it. The reference is:

> Hamelryck, T., Manderick, B. (2003) PDB parser and structure class
> implemented in Python. *Bioinformatics* **19**: 2308–2310

The article can be freely downloaded via the [Bioinformatics journal
website](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg299). I
welcome e-mails telling me what you are using `Bio.PDB` for. Feature
requests are welcome too.

How well tested is Bio.PDB?
---------------------------

Pretty well, actually. `Bio.PDB` has been extensively tested on nearly
5500 structures from the PDB - all structures seemed to be parsed
correctly. More details can be found in the `Bio.PDB` Bioinformatics
article. `Bio.PDB` has been used/is being used in many research projects
as a reliable tool. In fact, I'm using `Bio.PDB` almost daily for research
purposes and continue working on improving it and adding new features.

How fast is it?
---------------

The `PDBParser` performance was tested on about 800 structures (each
belonging to a unique SCOP superfamily). This takes about 20 minutes, or
on average 1.5 seconds per structure. Parsing the structure of the large
ribosomal subunit (1FKK), which contains about 64000 atoms, takes 10
seconds on a 1000 MHz PC. In short: it's more than fast enough for many
applications.

Why should I use Bio.PDB?
-------------------------

`Bio.PDB` might be exactly what you want, and then again it might not. If
you are interested in data mining the PDB header, you might want to look
elsewhere because there is only limited support for this. If you look
for a powerful, complete data structure to access the atomic data
`Bio.PDB` is probably for you.

Usage
-----

### General questions

#### Importing Bio.PDB

That's simple:

``` python
from Bio.PDB import *
```

#### Is there support for molecular graphics?

Not directly, mostly since there are quite a few Python based/Python
aware solutions already, that can potentially be used with `Bio.PDB`. My
choice is Pymol, BTW (I've used this successfully with `Bio.PDB`, and
there will probably be specific PyMol modules in `Bio.PDB` soon/some day).
Python based/aware molecular graphics solutions include:

-   PyMol: <http://pymol.org>
-   Chimera: <http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/>
-   PMV: <http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/pmv>
-   Coot: <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/>
-   CCP4mg: <http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/MG/>
-   mmLib: <http://pymmlib.sourceforge.net/>
-   VMD: <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>
-   MMTK: <http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/MMTK/>

I'd be crazy to write another molecular graphics application (been there
done that, actually :-).

You can however interactively view Biopython structural entities in a Jupyter
notebook using [nglview](https://github.com/arose/nglview):

```python
import nglview as nv
view = nv.show_biopython(structure)
view
```

### Input/output

#### How do I create a structure object from a PDB file?

First, create a `PDBParser` object:

``` python
parser = PDBParser()
```

Then, create a structure object from a PDB file in the following way
(the PDB file in this case is called `1FAT.pdb`, `PHA-L` is a user
defined name for the structure):

``` python
structure = parser.get_structure('PHA-L', '1FAT.pdb')
```

#### How do I create a structure object from an mmCIF file?

Similarly to the case the case of PDB files, first create an
`MMCIFParser` object:

``` python
parser = MMCIFParser()
```

Then use this parser to create a structure object from the mmCIF file:

``` python
structure = parser.get_structure('PHA-L', '1FAT.cif')
```

#### ...and what about the new PDB XML format?

That's not yet supported, but I'm definitely planning to support that in
the future (it's not a lot of work). Contact me if you need this, it
might encourage me :-).

#### I'd like to have some more low level access to an mmCIF file...

You got it. You can create a Python dictionary that maps all mmCIF tags
in an mmCIF file to their values. If there are multiple values (like in
the case of tag `_atom_site.Cartn_y`, which holds the *y* coordinates of
all atoms), the tag is mapped to a list of values. The dictionary is
created from the mmCIF file as follows:

``` python
mmcif_dict = MMCIF2Dict('1FAT.cif')
```

Example: get the solvent content from an mmCIF file:

``` python
sc = mmcif_dict['_exptl_crystal.density_percent_sol']
```

Example: get the list of the *y* coordinates of all atoms

``` python
y_list = mmcif_dict['_atom_site.Cartn_y']
```

#### Can I access the header information?

Thanks to Christian Rother you can access some information from the PDB
header. Note however that many PDB files contain headers with incomplete
or erroneous information. Many of the errors have been fixed in the
equivalent mmCIF files. **Hence, if you are interested in the header
information, it is a good idea to extract information from mmCIF files
using the `MMCIF2Dict` tool described above, instead of parsing the PDB
header.**

Now that is clarified, let's return to parsing the PDB header. The
structure object has an attribute called `header` which is a python
dictionary that maps header records to their values.

Example:

``` python
resolution = structure.header['resolution']
keywords = structure.header['keywords']
```

The available keys are `name`, `head`, `deposition_date`,
`release_date`, `structure_method`, `resolution`, `structure_reference`
(maps to a list of references), `journal_reference`, `author` and
`compound` (maps to a dictionary with various information about the
crystallized compound).

The dictionary can also be created without creating a `Structure`
object, ie. directly from the PDB file:

``` python
handle = open(filename,'r')
header_dict = parse_pdb_header(handle)
handle.close()
```

#### Can I use Bio.PDB with NMR structures (ie. with more than one model)?

Sure. Many PDB parsers assume that there is only one model, making them
all but useless for NMR structures. The design of the `Structure` object
makes it easy to handle PDB files with more than one model (see section
[**The Structure Object**](#the-structure-object "wikilink")).

#### How do I download structures from the PDB?

This can be done using the `PDBList` object, using the
`retrieve_pdb_file` method. The argument for this method is the PDB
identifier of the structure.

``` python
pdbl = PDBList()
pdbl.retrieve_pdb_file('1FAT')
```

The `PDBList` class can also be used as a command-line tool:

``` bash
python PDBList.py 1fat
```

The downloaded file will be called `pdb1fat.ent` and
stored in the current working directory. Note that the
`retrieve_pdb_file` method also has an optional argument `pdir` that
specifies a specific directory in which to store the downloaded PDB
files.

The `retrieve_pdb_file` method also has some options for specifying the
compression format used for the download, and the program used for local
decompression (default `.Z` format and `gunzip`). In addition, the PDB
ftp site can be specified upon creation of the `PDBList` object. By
default, the ftp server of the [Worldwide Protein Data
Bank](ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/data/structures/divided/pdb/) is used. See
the API documentation for more details. Thanks again to Kristian Rother
for donating this module.

#### How do I download the entire PDB?

The following commands will store all PDB files in the `/data/pdb`
directory:

``` python
python PDBList.py all /data/pdb
python PDBList.py all /data/pdb -d
```

The API method for this is called `download_entire_pdb`. Adding the `-d`
option will store all files in the same directory. Otherwise, they are
sorted into PDB-style subdirectories according to their PDB ID's.
Depending on the traffic, a complete download will take 2-4 days.

#### How do I keep a local copy of the PDB up-to-date?

This can also be done using the `PDBList` object. One simply creates a
`PDBList` object (specifying the directory where the local copy of the
PDB is present) and calls the `update_pdb` method:

``` python
pl = PDBList(pdb='/data/pdb')
pl.update_pdb()
```

One can of course make a weekly cronjob out of this to keep the local
copy automatically up-to-date. The PDB ftp site can also be specified
(see API documentation).

`PDBList` has some additional methods that can be of use. The
`get_all_obsolete` method can be used to get a list of all obsolete PDB
entries. The `changed_this_week` method can be used to obtain the
entries that were added, modified or obsoleted during the current week.
For more info on the possibilities of `PDBList`, see the API
documentation.

#### What about all those buggy PDB files?

It is well known that many PDB files contain semantic errors (I'm not
talking about the structures themselves, but their representation
in PDB files). `Bio.PDB` tries to handle this in two ways. The `PDBParser`
object can behave in two ways: a restrictive way and a permissive way
(THIS IS NOW THE DEFAULT). The restrictive way used to be the default,
but people seemed to think that `Bio.PDB` 'crashed' due to a bug (hah!),
so I changed it. If you ever encounter a real bug, please tell me
immediately!

Example:

``` python
# Permissive parser
parser = PDBParser(PERMISSIVE=1)
parser = PDBParser()  # The same (default)
# Strict parser
strict_parser = PDBParser(PERMISSIVE=0)
```

In the permissive state (DEFAULT), PDB files that obviously contain
errors are 'corrected' (i.e. some residues or atoms are left out). These
errors include:

-   Multiple residues with the same identifier
-   Multiple atoms with the same identifier (taking into account the
    altloc identifier)

These errors indicate real problems in the PDB file (for details see the
Bioinformatics article). In the restrictive state, PDB files with errors
cause an exception to occur. This is useful to find errors in PDB files.

Some errors however are automatically corrected. Normally each
disordered atom should have a non-blank altloc identifier. However,
there are many structures that do not follow this convention, and have a
blank and a non-blank identifier for two disordered positions of the
same atom. This is automatically interpreted in the right way.

Sometimes a structure contains a list of residues belonging to chain A,
followed by residues belonging to chain B, and again followed by
residues belonging to chain A, i.e. the chains are 'broken'. This is
also correctly interpreted.

#### Can I write PDB files?

Use the `PDBIO` class for this. It's easy to write out specific parts of a
structure too, of course.

Example: saving a structure

``` python
io = PDBIO()
io.set_structure(s)
io.save('out.pdb')
```

If you want to write out a part of the structure, make use of the
`Select` class (also in `PDBIO`). Select has four methods:

``` python
accept_model(model)
accept_chain(chain)
accept_residue(residue)
accept_atom(atom)
```

By default, every method returns 1 (which means the
model/chain/residue/atom is included in the output). By subclassing
`Select` and returning 0 when appropriate you can exclude models,
chains, etc. from the output. Cumbersome maybe, but very powerful. The
following code only writes out glycine residues:

``` python
class GlySelect(Select):
    def accept_residue(self, residue):
        if residue.get_name()=='GLY':
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

io = PDBIO()
io.set_structure(s)
io.save('gly_only.pdb', GlySelect())
```

If this is all too complicated for you, the `Dice` module contains a
handy `extract` function that writes out all residues in a chain between
a start and end residue.

#### Can I write mmCIF files?

No, and I also don't have plans to add that functionality soon (or ever
- I don't need it at all, and it's a lot of work, plus no-one has ever
asked for it). People who want to add this can contact me.

### The Structure Object

#### What's the overall layout of a Structure object?

The `Structure` object follows the so-called **SMCRA**
(Structure/Model/Chain/Residue/Atom) architecture :

-   A structure consists of models
-   A model consists of chains
-   A chain consists of residues
-   A residue consists of atoms

This is the way many structural biologists/bioinformaticians think about
structure, and provides a simple but efficient way to deal with
structure. Additional stuff is essentially added when needed. A UML
diagram of the `Structure` object (forgetting about the `Disordered`
classes for now) is shown in the figure below.

**Diagram of SMCRA architecture of the Structure object.**

*Full lines with diamonds denote aggregation, full lines with arrows denote
referencing, full lines with triangles denote inheritance and dashed lines with
triangles denote interface realization.*



#### How do I navigate through a Structure object?

The following code iterates through all atoms of a structure:

``` python
p = PDBParser()
structure = p.get_structure('X', 'pdb1fat.ent')
for model in structure:
    for chain in model:
        for residue in chain:
            for atom in residue:
                print atom
```

There are also some shortcuts:

``` python
# Iterate over all atoms in a structure
for atom in structure.get_atoms():
    print atom

# Iterate over all residues in a model
for residue in model.get_residues():
    print residue
```

Structures, models, chains, residues and atoms are called **Entities**
in Biopython. You can always get a parent `Entity` from a child
`Entity`, e.g.:

``` python
residue = atom.get_parent()
chain = residue.get_parent()
```

You can also test whether an `Entity` has a certain child using the
`has_id` method.

#### Can I do that a bit more conveniently?

You can do things like:

``` python
atoms = structure.get_atoms()
residues = structure.get_residues()
atoms = chain.get_atoms()
```

You can also use the `Selection.unfold_entities` function:

``` python
# Get all residues from a structure
res_list = Selection.unfold_entities(structure, 'R')
# Get all atoms from a chain
atom_list = Selection.unfold_entities(chain, 'A')
```

Obviously, `A`=atom, `R`=residue, `C`=chain, `M`=model, `S`=structure.
You can use this to go up in the hierarchy, e.g. to get a list of
(unique) `Residue` or `Chain` parents from a list of `Atom`s:

``` python
residue_list = Selection.unfold_entities(atom_list, 'R')
chain_list = Selection.unfold_entities(atom_list, 'C')
```

For more info, see the API documentation.

#### How do I extract a specific `Atom`/`Residue`/`Chain`/`Model` from a `Structure`?

Easy. Here are some examples:

``` python
model = structure[0]
chain = model['A']
residue = chain[100]
atom = residue['CA']
```

Note that you can use a shortcut:

``` python
atom = structure[0]['A'][100]['CA']
```

#### What is a model id?

The *model id*  is an integer which denotes the rank of the model in the
PDB/mmCIF file. The *model id* starts at 0. Crystal structures generally
have only one model (with *id* 0), while NMR files usually have several
models.

#### What is a chain id?

The *chain id*  is specified in the PDB/mmCIF file, and is a single
character (typically a letter).

#### What is a residue id?

This is a bit more complicated, due to the clumsy PDB format. A *residue
id* is a tuple with three elements:

-   The **hetero-flag**: this is `'H_'` plus the name of the
    hetero-residue (e.g. `'H_GLC'` in the case of a glucose molecule),
    or `'W'` in the case of a water molecule.
-   The **sequence identifier** in the chain, e.g. 100
-   The **insertion code**, e.g. `'A'`. The insertion code is sometimes
    used to preserve a certain desirable residue numbering scheme. A Ser
    80 insertion mutant (inserted e.g. between a Thr 80 and an Asn
    81 residue) could e.g. have sequence identifiers and insertion codes
    as follows: Thr 80 A, Ser 80 B, Asn 81. In this way the residue
    numbering scheme stays in tune with that of the wild type structure.

The id of the above glucose residue would thus be `('H_GLC', 100, 'A')`.
If the hetero-flag and insertion code are blank, the sequence
identifier alone can be used:

``` python
# Full id
residue = chain[(' ', 100, ' ')]
# Shortcut id
residue = chain[100]
```

The reason for the hetero-flag is that many, many PDB files use the same
sequence identifier for an amino acid and a hetero-residue or a water,
which would create obvious problems if the hetero-flag was not used.

#### What is an atom id?

The *atom id*  is simply the atom name (eg. `'CA'`). In practice, the atom
name is created by stripping all spaces from the atom name in the PDB
file.

However, in PDB files, a space can be part of an atom name. Often,
calcium atoms are called `'CA..'` in order to distinguish them from Cα
atoms (which are called `'.CA.'`). In cases were stripping the spaces
would create problems (ie. two atoms called `'CA'` in the same residue)
the spaces are kept.

#### How is disorder handled?

This is one of the strong points of `Bio.PDB`. It can handle both
disordered atoms and point mutations (ie. a Gly and an Ala residue in
the same position).

Disorder should be dealt with from two points of view: the atom and the
residue points of view. In general, I have tried to encapsulate all the
complexity that arises from disorder. If you just want to loop over all
Cα atoms, you do not care that some residues have a disordered side
chain. On the other hand it should also be possible to represent
disorder completely in the data structure. Therefore, disordered atoms
or residues are stored in special objects that behave as if there is no
disorder. This is done by only representing a subset of the disordered
atoms or residues. Which subset is picked (e.g. which of the two
disordered OG side chain atom positions of a Ser residue is used) can be
specified by the user.

**Disordered atom positions** are represented by ordinary `Atom`
objects, but all `Atom` objects that represent the same physical atom
are stored in a `DisorderedAtom` object (see section [**The Structure
Object**](#the-structure-object "wikilink")). Each `Atom` object in a
`DisorderedAtom` object can be uniquely indexed using its altloc
specifier. The `DisorderedAtom` object forwards all uncaught method
calls to the selected Atom object, by default the one that represents
the atom with the highest occupancy. The user can of course change the
selected `Atom` object, making use of its altloc specifier. In this way
atom disorder is represented correctly without much additional
complexity. In other words, if you are not interested in atom disorder,
you will not be bothered by it.

Each disordered atom has a characteristic altloc identifier. You can
specify that a `DisorderedAtom` object should behave like the `Atom`
object associated with a specific altloc identifier:

``` python
atom.disordered_select('A')  # select altloc A atom
atom.disordered_select('B')  # select altloc B atom
```

A special case arises when disorder is due to **point mutations**, i.e.
when two or more point mutants of a polypeptide are present in the
crystal. An example of this can be found in PDB structure 1EN2.

Since these residues belong to a different residue type (e.g. let's say
Ser 60 and Cys 60) they should not be stored in a single `Residue`
object as in the common case. In this case, each residue is represented
by one `Residue` object, and both `Residue` objects are stored in a
single `DisorderedResidue` object (see section [**The Structure
Object**](#the-structure-object "wikilink")).

The `DisorderedResidue` object forwards all uncaught methods to the
selected `Residue` object (by default the last `Residue` object added),
and thus behaves like an ordinary residue. Each `Residue` object in a
`DisorderedResidue` object can be uniquely identified by its residue
name. In the above example, residue Ser 60 would have id 'SER' in the
`DisorderedResidue` object, while residue Cys 60 would have id 'CYS'.
The user can select the active `Residue` object in a `DisorderedResidue`
object via this id.

Example: suppose that a chain has a point mutation at position 10,
consisting of a Ser and a Cys residue. Make sure that residue 10 of this
chain behaves as the Cys residue.

``` python
residue = chain[10]
residue.disordered_select('CYS')
```

In addition, you can get a list of all `Atom` objects (ie. all
`DisorderedAtom` objects are 'unpacked' to their individual `Atom`
objects) using the `get_unpacked_list` method of a
(`Disordered`)`Residue` object.

#### Can I sort residues in a chain somehow?

Yes, kinda, but I'm waiting for a request for this feature to finish it
:-).

#### How are ligands and solvent handled?

See ['What is a residue id?'](#what-is-a-residue-id "wikilink").

#### What about B factors?

Well, yes! `Bio.PDB` supports isotropic and anisotropic B factors, and
also deals with standard deviations of anisotropic B factor if present
(see the section [**Analysis**](#analysis "wikilink")).

#### What about standard deviation of atomic positions?

Yup, supported. See the section [**Analysis**](#analysis "wikilink").

#### I think the SMCRA data structure is not flexible/sexy/whatever enough...

Sure, sure. Everybody is always coming up with (mostly vaporware or
partly implemented) data structures that handle all possible situations
and are extensible in all thinkable (and unthinkable) ways. The prosaic
truth however is that 99.9% of people using (and I mean really using!)
crystal structures think in terms of models, chains, residues and atoms.
The philosophy of `Bio.PDB` is to provide a reasonably fast, clean,
simple, but complete data structure to access structure data. The proof
of the pudding is in the eating.

Moreover, it is quite easy to build more specialised data structures on
top of the `Structure` class (eg. there's a `Polypeptide` class). On the
other hand, the `Structure` object is built using a Parser/Consumer
approach (called `PDBParser`/`MMCIFParser` and `StructureBuilder`,
respectively). One can easily reuse the PDB/mmCIF parsers by
implementing a specialised `StructureBuilder` class. It is of course
also trivial to add support for new file formats by writing new parsers.

### Analysis

#### How do I extract information from an `Atom` object?

Using the following methods:

``` python
a.get_name()       # atom name (spaces stripped, e.g. 'CA')
a.get_id()         # id (equals atom name)
a.get_coord()      # atomic coordinates
a.get_vector()     # atomic coordinates as Vector object
a.get_bfactor()    # isotropic B factor
a.get_occupancy()  # occupancy
a.get_altloc()     # alternative location specifier
a.get_sigatm()     # std. dev. of atomic parameters
a.get_siguij()     # std. dev. of anisotropic B factor
a.get_anisou()     # anisotropic B factor
a.get_fullname()   # atom name (with spaces, e.g. '.CA.')
```

#### How do I extract information from a `Residue` object?

Using the following methods:

``` python
r.get_resname()    # return the residue name (eg. 'GLY')
r.is_disordered()  # 1 if the residue has disordered atoms
r.get_segid()      # return the SEGID
r.has_id(name)     # test if a residue has a certain atom
```

#### How do I measure distances?

That's simple: the minus operator for atoms has been overloaded to
return the distance between two atoms.

Example:

``` python
# Get some atoms
ca1 = residue1['CA']
ca2 = residue2['CA']
# Simply subtract the atoms to get their distance
distance = ca1 - ca2
```

#### How do I measure angles?

This can easily be done via the vector representation of the atomic
coordinates, and the `calc_angle` function from the `Vector` module:

``` python
vector1 = atom1.get_vector()
vector2 = atom2.get_vector()
vector3 = atom3.get_vector()
angle = calc_angle(vector1, vector2, vector3)
```

#### How do I measure torsion angles?

Again, this can easily be done via the vector representation of the
atomic coordinates, this time using the `calc_dihedral` function from
the `Vector` module:

``` python
vector1 = atom1.get_vector()
vector2 = atom2.get_vector()
vector3 = atom3.get_vector()
vector4 = atom4.get_vector()
angle = calc_dihedral(vector1, vector2, vector3, vector4)
```

#### How do I determine atom-atom contacts?

Use `NeighborSearch`. This uses a KD tree data structure coded in C
behind the screens, so it's pretty darn fast (see `Bio.KDTree`).

#### How do I extract polypeptides from a `Structure` object?

Use `PolypeptideBuilder`. You can use the resulting `Polypeptide` object
to get the sequence as a `Seq` object or to get a list of Cα atoms as
well. Polypeptides can be built using a C-N or a Cα-Cα distance
criterion.

Example:

``` python
# Using C-N
ppb = PPBuilder()
for pp in ppb.build_peptides(structure):
    print(pp.get_sequence())

# Using CA-CA
ppb = CaPPBuilder()
for pp in ppb.build_peptides(structure):
    print(pp.get_sequence())
```

Note that in the above case only model 0 of the structure is considered
by `PolypeptideBuilder`. However, it is possible to use
`PolypeptideBuilder` to build `Polypeptide` objects from `Model` and
`Chain` objects as well.

#### How do I get the sequence of a structure?

The first thing to do is to extract all polypeptides from the structure
(see previous entry). The sequence of each polypeptide can then easily
be obtained from the `Polypeptide` objects. The sequence is represented
as a Biopython `Seq` object, and its alphabet is defined by a
`ProteinAlphabet` object.

Example:

``` python
>>> seq = polypeptide.get_sequence()
>>> print seq
Seq('SNVVE...', <class Bio.Alphabet.ProteinAlphabet>)
```

#### How do I determine secondary structure?

For this functionality, you need to install
[DSSP](http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/dssp/) (and obtain a license
for it - free for academic use).
Then use the `DSSP` class, which maps `Residue` objects to their
secondary structure (and accessible surface area). The DSSP codes are
listed in the Table below. Note that DSSP (the program, and thus by
consequence the class) cannot handle multiple models!

| DSSP Code | Secondary structure       |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| H         | α-helix                   |

#### How do I calculate the accessible surface area of a residue?

Use the `DSSP` class (see also previous entry). But see also next entry.

#### How do I calculate residue depth?

Residue depth is the average distance of a residue's atoms from the
solvent accessible surface. It's a fairly new and very powerful
parameterization of solvent accessibility. For this functionality, you
need to install [Michel Sanner's MSMS
program](http://mgl.scripps.edu/people/sanner/html/msms_home.html).
Then use the `ResidueDepth` class. This class behaves as a dictionary
which maps `Residue` objects to corresponding (residue depth, Cα depth)
tuples. The Cα depth is the distance of a residue's Cα atom to the
solvent accessible surface.

Example:

``` python
model = structure[0]
rd = ResidueDepth(model, pdb_file)
residue_depth, ca_depth = rd[some_residue]
```

You can also get access to the molecular surface itself (via the
`get_surface` function), in the form of a NumPy array with the
surface points.

#### How do I calculate Half Sphere Exposure?

Half Sphere Exposure (HSE) is a new, 2D measure of solvent exposure.
Basically, it counts the number of Cα atoms around a residue in the
direction of its side chain, and in the opposite direction (within a
radius of 13 Å). Despite its simplicity, it outperforms many other
measures of solvent exposure. An article describing this novel 2D
measure has been submitted.

HSE comes in two flavors: HSEα and HSEβ. The former only uses the Cα
atom positions, while the latter uses the Cα and Cβ atom positions. The
HSE measure is calculated by the `HSExposure` class, which can also
calculate the contact number. The latter class has methods which return
dictionaries that map a `Residue` object to its corresponding HSEα, HSEβ
and contact number values.

Example:

``` python
model = structure[0]
hse = HSExposure()
# Calculate HSEalpha
exp_ca = hse.calc_hs_exposure(model, option='CA3')
# Calculate HSEbeta
exp_cb = hse.calc_hs_exposure(model, option='CB')
# Calculate classical coordination number
exp_fs = hse.calc_fs_exposure(model)
# Print HSEalpha for a residue
print exp_ca[some_residue]
```

#### How do I map the residues of two related structures onto each other?

First, create an alignment file in FASTA format, then use the
`StructureAlignment` class. This class can also be used for alignments
with more than two structures.

#### How do I test if a Residue object is an amino acid?

Use `is_aa(residue)`.

#### Can I do vector operations on atomic coordinates?

`Atom` objects return a `Vector` object representation of the
coordinates with the `get_vector` method. `Vector` implements the full
set of 3D vector operations, matrix multiplication (left and right) and
some advanced rotation-related operations as well. See also next
question.

#### How do I put a virtual Cβ on a Gly residue?

OK, I admit, this example is only present to show off the possibilities
of `Bio.PDB`'s `Vector` module (though this code is actually used in the
`HSExposure` module, which contains a novel way to parametrize residue
exposure - publication underway). Suppose that you would like to find
the position of a Gly residue's Cβ atom, if it had one. How would you do
that? Well, rotating the N atom of the Gly residue along the Cα-C bond
over -120 degrees roughly puts it in the position of a virtual Cβ atom.
Here's how to do it, making use of the `rotaxis` method (which can be
used to construct a rotation around a certain axis) of the `Vector`
module:

``` python
# get atom coordinates as vectors
n = residue['N'].get_vector()
c = residue['C'].get_vector()
ca = residue['CA'].get_vector()
# center at origin
n = n - ca
c = c - ca
# find rotation matrix that rotates n -120 degrees along the ca-c vector
rot = rotaxis(-pi*120.0/180.0, c)
# apply rotation to ca-n vector
cb_at_origin = n.left_multiply(rot)
# put on top of ca atom
cb = cb_at_origin + ca
```

This example shows that it's possible to do some quite nontrivial vector
operations on atomic data, which can be quite useful. In addition to all
the usual vector operations (cross (use `**`), and dot (use `*`)
product, angle, norm, etc.) and the above mentioned `rotaxis`
function, the `Vector` module also has methods to rotate (`rotmat`)
or reflect (`refmat`) one vector on top of another.

### Manipulating the structure

#### How do I superimpose two structures?

Surprisingly, this is done using the `Superimposer` object. This object
calculates the rotation and translation matrix that rotates two lists of
atoms on top of each other in such a way that their RMSD is minimized.
Of course, the two lists need to contain the same amount of atoms. The
`Superimposer` object can also apply the rotation/translation to a list
of atoms. The rotation and translation are stored as a tuple in the
`rotran` attribute of the `Superimposer` object (note that the rotation
is right multiplying!). The RMSD is stored in the `rmsd` attribute.

The algorithm used by `Superimposer` comes from [Matrix
computations, 2nd ed. Golub, G. & Van Loan
(1989)](http://web.mit.edu/ehliu/Public/sclark/Golub%20G.H.,%20Van%20Loan%20C.F.-%20Matrix%20Computations.pdf)
and makes use of singular value decomposition (this is implemented in the
general `Bio.SVDSuperimposer` module).

Example:

``` python
sup = Superimposer()
# Specify the atom lists
# 'fixed' and 'moving' are lists of Atom objects
# The moving atoms will be put on the fixed atoms
sup.set_atoms(fixed, moving)
# Print rotation/translation/rmsd
print sup.rotran
print sup.rms
# Apply rotation/translation to the moving atoms
sup.apply(moving)
```

#### How do I superimpose two structures based on their active sites?

Pretty easily. Use the active site atoms to calculate the
rotation/translation matrices (see above), and apply these to the whole
molecule.

#### Can I manipulate the atomic coordinates?

Yes, using the `transform` method of the `Atom` object, or directly
using the `set_coord` method.
