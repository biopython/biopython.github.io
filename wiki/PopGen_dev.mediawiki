=Development page for the PopGen module.=

==abstract==
The [[PopGen]] module will contain modules to handle population genetics data.

==use cases==
Some use cases are hosted (temporarily) here:
* http://github.com/dalloliogm/bio-test-datasets-repository/tree/master/usecases/popgen

==code==
Some of the code is actually been hosted on github:
* http://github.com/dalloliogm/biopython---popgen/commits/master

==how to contribute==
The recommended way is to create an account on github (free), and then click on the 'Fork' button (something like http://github.com/dalloliogm/biopython---popgen/fork) and then start working on your separated branch.
When you will have changes that you will consider functional, tell us and we will integrate in the ufficial popgen branch (mine?)

==wishing list==
* support for a binary format - like [http://www.pytables.org HDF5]  or this one: [http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2008-December/004830.html snpfile]
* support for database: it is frequent to carry analysis on a big scale, so it is not unfrequent to use databases to store data
