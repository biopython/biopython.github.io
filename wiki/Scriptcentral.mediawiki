We use it at Harbor-UCLA for health/treatment outcomes data. Forms/metadata can be exported+imported as XML and exchanged via the online OIO Library at www.TxOutcome.Org. It is written in Zope/Python and uses the PostgreSQL database backend. It has not been used to manage gene sequence/annotation data to my knowledge but it would be trivial to extend it for those functions.
