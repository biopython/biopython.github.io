#### Documentation

-   Installation instructions cover the installation of Python itself,
    the Biopython dependencies, and Biopython itself.

  
[HTML](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.html) |
[PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/install/Installation.pdf)

-   The Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook contains the main bulk of
    Biopython documentation. It provides information to get you started
    with Biopython, in addition to specific documentation on a number
    of modules.
