#### Documentation

-   Installation instructions cover the installation of Python itself,
    the Biopython dependencies, and Biopython itself.

[PDF](http://biopython.open-bio.org/static/DIST/Installation.pdf)

-   The Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook contains the main bulk of
    Biopython documentation. It provides information to get you started
    with Biopython, in addition to specific documentation on a number
    of modules.
