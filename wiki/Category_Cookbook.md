The entries contained in the Cookbook category are designed to
complement the general help given in the
[Tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)) with
specific examples of problems that can be solved with the Biopython
tools.

This collection of examples is a new effort for Biopython, so is
currently a little short. If you have suggestions for topics, please
raise them on the [mailing lists](Mailing_lists "wikilink"). If you have
some example code of your own to put forward for this cookbook
collection, that's even better. By sharing it hopefully the community
can comment on your code, and perhaps improve it, helping both you and
future Biopython users.

Alternatively, are there any examples in the
[Tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)) which you
think would be worth copying (or moving) here? Let us know on the
[mailing lists](Mailing_lists "wikilink").

Thanks
