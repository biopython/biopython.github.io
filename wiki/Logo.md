Our logo was created by Henrik Vestergaard and Thomas Hamelryck back in
2003. Inspired by the structure of DNA, it shows two golden pythons
twisting in opposite directions to form a double helix around the word
Biopython:

This is a cropped version of
[biopython.jpg](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/images/biopython.jpg),
[biopython\_small.jpg](http://www.biopython.org/DIST/docs/images/biopython_small.jpg)
is also available.

As of Biopython release 1.50, we've included the logo on the front cover
of the [Biopython Tutorial and
Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html)
([PDF](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf)), which had
previously been rather plain.

This design was chosen from panel of entries to an open competition on
the mailing lists back in [Summer
2003](http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython/2003-June/001389.html).
Our website doesn't have the other competition entries on it any more,
so it might be fun to reassemble them here...
