I'm one of the many [Biopython participants](Participants "wikilink"),
having first started using the code back in 2004 or there abouts.

My main contributions are the [Bio.SeqIO](SeqIO "wikilink") and
[Bio.AlignIO](AlignIO "wikilink") modules and some of the underlying
parsers. I've also worked on [Biopython's BioSQL
interface](BioSQL "wikilink").

There are some nice examples on my [python
pages](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/peter_cock/python/).
