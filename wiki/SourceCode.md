The source code from Biopython is freely available for your use and
contribution. The core developers maintain a stable trunk under revision
control from which we will roll releases as new functionality is
integrated and bugs are fixed.

We currently use [CVS](CVS "wikilink") as our revision control system;
full details are available from the [CVS](CVS "wikilink") page.

We are currently evaluating a transition to git on
[github](http://www.github.com), details are available from the [git
migration](GitMigration "wikilink") page. We are happy to hear your
feedback on the [ mailing lists](Mailing_lists "wikilink").
